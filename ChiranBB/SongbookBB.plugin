		<Description><![CDATA[SongbookBB 0.99A-1 BETA:

Songbook is a plugin for browsing your abc song files and playing them with a click of a button. The plugin consists of two parts, an in-game plugin which displays the song library, and an external windows program that generates a list of your abc song files in a format that the plugin can read (Songbooker).

V0.93 added a band member list with visual indication of their play ready state, search filters/tags, and instrument line-ups for different band sizes using an external tool (Songbrowser.exe), as well as a much faster version of Songbooker, which also processes filter tags.

As of V0.97, it allows automatic parts assignment based on band member's instrument skills/preferences, along with some more interface improvements.

As of V0.99, it offers band members to autoselect the song and track that has been announced by the band leader.
